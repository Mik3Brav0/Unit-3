    <h1>Unit 3 - The candidate will prepare collaborative technologies for use</h1>
    <h2>4.1 - I can describe rules of engagement for using collaborative technologies</h2>

    <p>There may be a number of guidelines, or rules, to be followed in a remote collaborative setting. 
    These may be contained within a document on the intranet or supplied in advance, or given at the start of a meeting.</p>

    <p>One rule, as would be the case with a non-remote collaborative setting, is to not speak when another is speaking unless 
    invited to and to have one's microphone muted. This stops interruptions to a collaboration and reduces the length of time needed</p>

    <p>Another rule which has been common of late is to have your webcam turned on and facing you. This allows others to see you and for you to show
    you are paying attention to what is being said. This helps lessen the feeling of being remote and makes it easier to know if someone needs to speak,
    although programs like Microsoft Teams allow you to raise a digital hand showing you want to speak</p>

    <p>There may be a reason, to keep things professional, to avoid posting too many messages in the chat and not reacting to things said too often.</p>

    <p>There might, if the people attending the meeting from all over the world, be the requirement to liase in English (or the relevant native/ most-used 
    language) for the benefit of everyone understanding.
