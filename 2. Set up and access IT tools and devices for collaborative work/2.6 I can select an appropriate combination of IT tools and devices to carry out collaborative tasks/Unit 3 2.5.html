    <h1>Unit 3 - The candidate will prepare collaborative technologies for use</h1>
    <h2>2.5 I can describe the compatibility issues in different combinations of collaborative tools</h2>
    
    <p>The tools which I intend to use for the collaborative work I am or will be involved in are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A desktop computer using Windows 11 and associated hardware</li>
        <li>Google Chrome</li>
        <li>Microsoft Teams</li>
        <li>Microsoft Outlook</li>
        <li>Visual Studio 2019</li>

    </ul>
    <p><h3>A desktop computer and associated hardware</h3></p>

    <p>Whilst some smaller devices such as smart phones and tablets may have difficulty using applications, because of a smaller amount of storage space and RAM, this is not the case for my desktop computer. 
       I am confident that I will not encounter compatibility problems in this regard. The only feasible way I might have trouble is if I needed to use tools that were designed or made for Apple products. I know
       that iPhones can take pictures in file formats which can only be natively read on an Apple device, though my smartphone is Android which works well with Windows in my experience. Apple Macbooks are not always
        able to function using Visual Studio and a workaround may be needed, such as using the much smaller Visual Code. See more information below.
    
    <p><h3>Google Chrome</h3></p>

    <p>Whilst I have not encountered compatibility problems using Chrome with Windows 11, I have seen online that Chrome does not always work with Windows 10 and 11. Fortunately, like other internet browsers, 
        Chrome has a helpful compatibility troubleshooter. In addition, I understand Microsoft Edge uses the same technology as Chrome and naturally Edge works with Windows.

    <p><h3>Microsoft Teams</h3></p>

    <p>I would like to be able to download and use Microsoft Teams to talk with other people on and off the course I am on, but at present only those with a school or work account can do so. Whilst there is an online-
        based version which can do this, it does not have so many features and so is not compatible with what I would otherwise need it for. Microsoft Teams is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

    <p><h3>Microsoft Outlook 2019</h3></p>

    <p>Outlook works well with Windows and is appropriate for me to use because I have Microsoft Office. Previous versions of Outlook could not support some file types but for what I use it for and the files I am going 
        to be sending, I do not anticipate any trouble

    <p><h3>Visual Studio 2019</h3></p>

    <p>Visual Studio is a free resource but takes up a lot of space. I do not have enough space to store it on my laptop or tablet so I am restricted to using it on my desktop computer. In addition, Visual Studio 2019 is not compatible with
        a macbook. Fortunately I do not have a macbook so this has not been a problem for me but those with a smaller device or with Macbook may need to use something like Visual Studio Code.
