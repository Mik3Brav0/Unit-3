    <h1>Unit 3 - The candidate will prepare collaborative technologies for use</h1>
    <h2>2.5 I can describe the compatibility issues in different combinations of collaborative tools</h2>
    
    <p>Some compatibility issues that may arise from the use of different collaborative tools are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>up to date drivers</li>
        <li>the correct cables and connectors</li>
        <li>software</li>
        <li>sufficient hardware</li>        
    </ul>

    <p><h3>Up to date drivers</h3></p>

    <p>It is far less common for this to be a problem with modern plug and play technology, where the operating system automatically finds the appropriate driver(s) to allow
        a device to function. If however accidentally a driver is deleted or moved, a device may not function properly or not at all. The means of resolving this issue would be to use
        something like Windows Update or the manufacturer's website to find the right driver.
        
    <p><h3>Cables and Connectors</h3></p>

    <p>Without the right cables/ connectors it is not possible to connect different collaborative tools unless a wireless medium can be used, such as WiFi or bluetooth. There are some
        common cables such as the USB varieties or HDMI, but some manufacturers make their products work only with bespoke or unique cables and adaptors. One can generally find what
        cable is required for the product, if there isn't one with it, by searching online for the device.

    <p><h3>Software</h3></p>

    <p>I would like to be able to download and use Microsoft Teams to talk with other people on and off the course I am on, but at present only those with a school or work account can do so. Another compatibility issue
        we have experienced is regarding Visual Studio 2019, which we have used to create our software application. It is a large size, and at the time of the course was not available
        on a mac. The person with a mac had to use a smaller version of the program made for those computers, as Visual Studio was not compatible.

    <p><h3>Hardware</h3></p>

    <p>In order to collaborate, a user will need the relevant hardware to do so. This means using a microphone and webcam if one is not already built in to the device being used
        to collaborate. On some devices it also means the granting of permissions to use the microphone/ webcam. If someone does not have these then they will be unable to collaborate
        as effectively.
